Evolutionary Image Generation Optimization (EIGO) is a framework for optimizing diffusion-based generative models through evolutionary prompt embedding search. It refines text-to-image generation using aesthetic and semantic metrics, enabling controllable, efficient, and black-box optimization without model retraining.
